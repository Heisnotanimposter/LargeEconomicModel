Key Features
1. User Interface
Drag and Drop:

What: Enable users to drag and drop events seamlessly onto a large calendar.

How:

Utilize HTML5’s native drag and drop APIs or leverage libraries like React Beautiful DND if using React.

Ensure smooth animations and real-time feedback upon drop.

Event Boxes (with strikethrough for completed tasks):

What: Allow users to mark events as complete by applying a line-through style to the event box.

How:

Implement state management that toggles a "completed" flag on events.

Use CSS (e.g., text-decoration: line-through;) to visually indicate completed events.

Add an interactive check or swipe gesture to trigger this action.

Graphs and Forecasts:

What: Provide visual representations of time forecast data alongside economic trends.

How:

Integrate charting libraries such as Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts (for React) to display line, area, or bar graphs.

Allow users to interact with graphs (e.g., zoom, hover for details) for a detailed breakdown of trends.

2. Economic Data Integration
Data Gathering:

What: Collect relevant economic indicators such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and market trends.

How:

Integrate established economic data APIs (like those from the World Bank, FRED, or other specialized providers).

Design a backend microservice to query, filter, and combine data sources.

Data Visualization:

What: Present the collected data as visual trends that aid in forecasting.

How:

Use interactive charts that correlate economic data with scheduled events.

Enable toggling between different data sets (e.g., inflation vs. employment data).

Real-time Updates:

What: Ensure the economic data, as well as the calendar events, remain current.

How:

Implement real-time data feeds (using WebSockets or server-sent events) for continuous updates.

Combine scheduled polling and event-driven updates to minimize latency.

3. Calendar Features
Customizable Views:

What: Offer multiple views—daily, weekly, and monthly—to cater to different planning preferences.

How:

Use a modular calendar component (e.g., FullCalendar) that supports multiple views and can be easily extended.

Reminders and Notifications:

What: Provide reminders for events and deadlines through notifications or emails.

How:

For browser notifications, integrate the Notification API.

For emails or in-app alerts, use a background scheduler that triggers reminders based on event time.

Collaborative Planning:

What: Allow multiple users to view and edit the same calendar in real-time.

How:

Implement user authentication and role-based access controls.

Use collaborative frameworks (or libraries like ShareDB for real-time editing) and handle data concurrency gracefully.

Steps to Build
1. Requirement Analysis
Define Application Requirements:

List all features (as outlined above) and capture user stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to drag and drop events...").

Prioritize features based on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) versus iterative enhancements.

Identify Data Sources:

Determine which economic data providers or APIs to integrate.

Assess their update frequencies, reliability, and terms of use.

2. Design Phase
Wireframes and Mockups:

Create detailed wireframes for the calendar view, event modals, and dashboard including graphs.

Tools: Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD can assist in rapid prototyping.

Database Schema and Data Flow:

User Data: Store user profiles, calendar settings, and collaboration permissions.

Event Data: Capture event details, timestamps, status (completed/incomplete).

Economic Data: Maintain a repository or cache of fetched economic data for quick access.

3. Development Phase
Frontend Development:

Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue can enhance your drag-and-drop and dynamic view capabilities.

Components:

Calendar Component (leveraging libraries like FullCalendar for customizable views).

Event Modal for detail editing and marking events complete.

Graph Component utilizing Chart.js or D3.js..

Backend Development:

Technologies: Node.js (Express), Python (Flask/Django), or similar to handle server-side logic and API integration.

Responsibilities:

Serve API endpoints for calendar events and real-time data updates.

Connect to economic data sources, process data, and send updates to the frontend.

Database:

Options:

SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) for structured relational data.

NoSQL (MongoDB) if you need more flexibility with scattered data points or caching economic data.

Considerations:

Design tables/collections for users, events, economic data, and logs (for notifications and real-time interactions).

Integration and Testing:

Integrate the economic data APIs and develop a local caching mechanism if needed.

Perform unit testing (frontend and backend) and conduct UI/UX testing with real users.
